# Software Engineer Job Description

At HealthTensor we use Artificial Intelligence to mine the medical record for
pertinent information, automate diagnoses, and create supporting documentation.
This allows physicians to spend more time with patients, improves care, and
optimizes finances for the physician and hospital.

HealthTensor is an agile, venture backed startup with partnerships into top
hospitals, e.g. Cedars-Sinai. We're a small but strong team hailing from
Stanford / MIT / Bain. We all work together to ship robust, quality code.

## You

You're a developer with at least three years of experience comfortable
working in a small team. Experience in healthcare is helpful, but not
required.

Ideally you live in Los Angeles or are willing to relocate.

## Responsiblities

You will design and develop the clinical algorithms that underpin our
product. At a high level this entails working with clinicians to map out
their diagnostic process, which you implement in code. Once built,
you'll collect feedback and iterate on your implementation.

- Write well tested, peer reviewed code
- Take beginning-to-end ownership of features
- Work closely with clinicians to codify clinical guidelines
- Develop algorithms to manipulate large medical data sets
- Help iterate and scale out the engineering team, from hiring to workflows
- Secure and maintain protected patient information


## Stack

Here are some of the tools we use day to day:

- Frontend: HTML5 / Javascript [ES2017] / React
- Backend: Python / Flask / pandas / sklearn
- Database: Postgresql / SQLAlchemy
- Hosting: AWS

(while proficiency in our stack is helpful, it's not a prerequisite for hiring)

## Perks and Benefits

- Work in sunny Santa Monica
- Medical, dental, and vision insurance
- Have a direct role in the development of a cutting edge product
- What perks are important to you?
